      <h2 id="myName">About me</h2>
        <p id="intro"> 
          As a RN I have directed and participated in medical codes saving lives for years, and now I write code for quality of life improvements as well.  I am incredibly passionate about the medical professions, health care, climate change, and how technology can be used to make improvements in these fields. I recently completed the fullstack flex bootcamp program through Thinkful.  The skills learned during my years as an RN corelate positively allowing me to excell in software development. Just a few of said skills include:  attention to detail, time management, experience with continued education, and the ability to go 12 hours without a bathroom break (ok maybe not that one).  When I am not writing code or directing medical codes I love to spend time with my family. I am a father of four children five years and under.  Time away from work is chaos and I love it.</p>

While I am very competent in my own abilities, my experience in life has proven time and again that I can accomplish much more as part of a team.
