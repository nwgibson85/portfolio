          <h2>Nicholas Gibson</h2>
        <p> 
          As a RN I have run codes to save lives for years, and now I write code for quality of life improvements as well.  I am incredibly passionate the medical professions, workerâ€™s rights, climate change, and how technology can be used to make improvements in these fields.  While continuing to work full time I have recently completed the fullstack flex bootcamp program through Thinkful.  Hard earned experience from nursing including:  attention to detail, time management, continued education, and the ability to go 12 hours without a bathroom break (ok maybe not that one) feed directly into web development.  When I am not writing code or running codes I love to spend time with the family. I am a father of four children five years and under.  Time away from work is chaos and I love it.</p>
