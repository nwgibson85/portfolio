      <h2 id="myName">About me</h2>
        <p id="intro"> 
          As a RN I have directed and participated in medical codes saving lives for years, and now I write code for quality of life improvements.  I am incredibly passionate about the medical professions, health care, climate change, and how technology can be used to make improvements in these fields. I completed the fullstack flex bootcamp program through Thinkful in February of 2020.  The skills learned during my years as an RN corelate positively allowing me to excell in software development. Just a few of said skills include:  attention to detail, time management, experience with continued education, and the ability to go 12 hours without a bathroom break (ok maybe not that one).  When I am not writing code or directing medical codes I love to spend time with my family. I am a father of five children eight years and under.  Time away from work is chaos and I love it.</p>

        <h2 id="why">Where have I been since completing the Thinkful bootcamp way back in February of 2020</h2>
          <p id="text">In March 2020 the world shut down thanks to a virus that became a plague. I put my career change on hold during the pandemic, because I felt my community needed me. I have recently decided to continue to with career change and am getting back into software development.</p>
        <h2 id="why">Why would a nurse learn to code?</h2>
          <p id="text">The issues that I encounter on a daily basis as an RN have empassioned me to learn software develpment. While I am very competent in my own abilities, my experience in life has proven time and again that I can accomplish much more as part of a team. I would love to add my experience and passion to your dev team.</p>
