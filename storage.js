  {title: 'IV Compatibility Optimizer',
  description: "I have been working with Epic EMR Custimization through their sandbox API to develop this application. In Critical Care nursing there are myriad IV drugs being administered at any one time. IV drug administration is very complex with just as many protocols and interactions to take into consideration. This application will take information that has already been input into the EMR by the health care professionals to provide an optimized route of administration for all prescribed IV Medications.",
